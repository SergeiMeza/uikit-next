# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in UIKit-Next. All forms of contribution are
welcome, from issue reports to PRs and documentation / write-ups.

Before you open a PR:

- In development, run `yarn dev` to build (and watch) the project source, and run
  the [development server](http://localhost:3000).
- Ensure that your effort is aligned with the project's roadmap by talking to
  the maintainers, especially if you are going to spend a lot of time on it.
- Make sure there's an issue open for any work you take on and intend to submit
  as a pull request - it helps core members review your concept and direction
  early and is a good way to discuss what you're planning to do.
- If you open an issue and are interested in working on a fix, please let us
  know. We'll help you get started, rather than inadvertently doubling up on your hard work.
